<strong>Atazzo is a premier technical, leadership, and data consultancy serving global clients.</strong></p></div><div class=content id=services><h1 id=leadership>Leadership</h1><p>Moving beyond an early-stage startup is as much dependent on leadership capabilities as customer acquisition. Once companies attain a product-market fit and begin to grow, it is often their internal leadership capabilities that are the determining factor between success and failure. We advise growth-stage startups in a variety of industries on how to grow and improve their leadership capabilities with great success.</p><h1 id=tech>Tech</h1><p>Whether it&rsquo;s Data Science and Machine Learning or scalability challenges with technology architecture, growth-stage companies have a unique set of needs. As customers and traffic levels grow, so must system performance. We have extensive experience in high-performance systems, including real-time systems, in a variety of industries.</p><h1 id=process>Process</h1><p>Before companies attain rapid growth, they are often able to scale without much in the way of formal process. This ceases to be sustainable when companies reach a certain level of complexity in technology and organizational structure. We help growth-stage startups design and implement lightweight processes that help sustain and increase growth.</p></div><div class=content id=team><h1 id=our-team>Our Team</h1><div class=content id=profile><div class=content id=headshot><p><img src=/img/headshots/adam_drake.jpg alt="Adam&rsquo;s photo"></p></div><div class=content id=bio><h1 id=adam-drake>Adam Drake</h1><p>Adam Drake leads technical business transformations in global and multi-cultural environments through leadership, technology, and data architecture guidance.
